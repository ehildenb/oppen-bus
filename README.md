# maude-foform
An implementation of a first-order formula datatype in Maude. The current version of FULL-MAUDE used is for Maude 2.7.1 but older versions of Maude should work (they might give warnings, however). To use the code as a library (or just play around in the REPL), run "load test-foform.maude" in your Maude interpreter.
