Oppen Bus
=========

The goal of this project is to implement the Nelson-Oppen combination method in Maude (for use by other Maude tools and any tools using Maude as an SMT solver).
This work is alpha (or maybe pre-alhpa).

Their is heavy re-use of the [Maude FO-Formula repo/code supplied by Stephen Skeirik](https://github.com/skeirik2/maude-foform).
